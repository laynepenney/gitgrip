"""Witnesses for the shared torn-line-safe JSONL primitives.

Both lane prototypes carried a BYTE-IDENTICAL ``append_jsonl`` and a reader with
the same body under two names. This is one defect with two addresses, not a class
with two instances, so it has one fix, one home, and one witness set.

* W1  a writer killed mid-write leaves a remnant: the append point survives it,
      the NEXT record is not GLUED onto it, and the remnant is skipped AND COUNTED
* W2  hostile line CONTENT neither bricks nor vanishes (validate, never coerce)
* W3  undecodable BYTES neither brick nor vanish, and a bad byte is CONFINED to
      its own line rather than destroying every record around it
* W4  the count has a REAL CONSUMER: warn_unreadable reports it, because a count
      nobody surfaces is the same silence as no count at all
