"""`review open-project` requires a project-review-KIND gr commit, and until now NO
CLI verb produced one — a stranger who did not author the code had no path from help
text to a multi-repo review. `review create-project` is the producer half of "one gr
commit opens one exact multi-repo review": from a materialized lane it prints the
``gr:<sha>`` that `review open-project` consumes.

These tests are the stranger acceptance: the verb exists, produces a consumable
commit pinned at the recorded fork base, refuses cleanly, and is discoverable from
help text alone.
